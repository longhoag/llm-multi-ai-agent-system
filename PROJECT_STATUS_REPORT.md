## 🧹 Cleanup Actions Completed

### Files Removed:
- ❌ `debug_agent_behavior.py` - Debug script (no longer needed)
- ❌ `test_upload_tool.py` - Individual tool test (superseded by comprehensive tests)
- ❌ `__pycache__/` directories - Python cache files
- ❌ All GPT-5-mini direct tool calling files (previously removed)

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `run_workflow.py` - Fixed imports and state naming conflicts
- ✅ Environment loading added to main workflow

### Current Clean File Structure:
